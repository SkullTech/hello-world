Let me introduce myself. I'm a newbie, nonetheless enthusiastic programmer. I'm learning Python, and along the way I'm planning to create some cool and useful projects, which will in turn help me learn and grow. 

Here in this repository, I'm planning to store ideas for future projects and some useful resources that I come by.
